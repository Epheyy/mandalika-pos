# HANDOFF — current state (read this first)

Short, living handoff for Claude sessions. **Overwrite "Now" and "Next" at each milestone; keep it under
~150 lines.** History: git log, `docs/plans/`, and earlier versions of this file (`git log -p HANDOFF.md`).
`SESSION_HANDOFF.md` (Codex era) is historical — read by section only.

## Progress board (update when a slice moves; show it at the end of every reply)

Goal: production-ready POS = 8 P0 audit findings closed + release gates. **8 of 8 P0s done.**
Remaining before go-live: fleet rollout of APK 1.7, legacy-envelope cutoff, release gates (A34), follow-ups below.

| P0 | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A13 | Concurrent transfers double-move stock | **Done** — slice 1 |
| A11 | Retried writes applied twice | **Done** for /sync/batch — slice 2 |
| A01 | Sale not durable on device | **Done** — slice 9 SQLite journal, APK 1.7, emulator-verified |
| A02 | Network failures park/delete financial events | **Done** — slice 5 (APK 1.2+) |
| A03 | Transfer-receive errors treated as competing receipt | **Done** — slices 3+5 (transfer receive not yet run on a device) |
| A04 | Queued events not bound to cashier/outlet | **Done** — slice 6; legacy cutoff not set; slice 10 device registration open |
| A06 | Refund permission bypassed via sync | **Done** — slice 7, emulator-verified (same-shift refund) |
| A09 | Sale/tender invariants not enforced | **Done** — slice 8 + 8c; discount permission split to 8b |

## Now (live state)

- **Backend:** Cloud Run `mandalika-pos` revision **`00094-per`** (100%, tag `ota9`) from `prod-hardening` @ `be3a3dd`.
  Contains slices 1–3, 6, 7, 8 + 8c, 9 (OTA `decide.go` strictly-newer), admin reset password. Migrations through **0047**.
  - Rollback: `gcloud run services update-traffic mandalika-pos --region asia-southeast2 --project mandalika-pos --to-revisions mandalika-pos-00092-naf=100`
    (00092-naf = slice 7 without the OTA change; 00090-wof = before slice 7, ignores 0047 columns).
  - `SYNC_LEGACY_ENVELOPE_UNTIL` **unset on purpose** (envelope-less items from APK ≤1.4 accepted + logged).
    Set it to *APK ≥1.5 on every tablet + 14 days* via `--set-env-vars` on a deploy. Use an explicit `+07:00` offset.
- **Backoffice:** Cloudflare Pages `https://mandalika-pos.pages.dev`, last deployed `64a608a` (slice 7: shift report
  "Refund dibayar (Tunai)" column + "oleh {nama}" on refunds). Auto-deploys on push unless the head commit starts `[CF-Pages-Skip]`.
- **POS:** **APK 1.7** (versionCode 8, run 38147374197) → `Downloads/mandalika-apk/mandalika-pos-1.7-build8.apk`.
  Older APKs (1.1–1.6) are in the same folder. **Fleet still on old versions** — not rolled out.
  - Slice 9 (plan `docs/plans/2026-10-11-p0-slice9-a01-journal.md`): outbox in an in-repo SQLite plugin
    (`OutboxJournalPlugin.java`, TRUNCATE + synchronous FULL, one transaction per save, never REPLACE, corruption
    never deletes the file); first-launch move copy→verify→backup→sentinel→sealed (resumable, one-way; after takeover
    any failure = BootError, never an empty queue); synced-refund memory in the journal; Android backup excludes the
    journal, Capacitor Preferences, WebView storage and Capgo state (restored tablet starts clean); Capacitor logging = production.
  - Emulator-verified 2026-10-11: 1.6→1.7 offline upgrade moved 2 queued sales byte-identical and synced once each;
    kill -9 at 50/200/800/2000 ms after Konfirmasi kept every sale; corrupt DB header → BootError, file kept (same md5);
    backup/restore via bmgr → clean start. Not on device: kill during the first migration (unit-tested).
  - Slice 7 on APK 1.6+ (plan `docs/plans/2026-10-11-p0-slice7-a06-refund.md`): refund gate (permission / open shift /
    no queued refund), reason 1–500, review detail, recap net of same- and cross-shift refunds, server holds
    shift_close/shift_open behind an earlier retryable failure. Verified: offline same-shift refund BSD-G0007.
- **Earlier slices:** plans in `docs/plans/2026-10-11-p0-slice6-a04-envelope.md`, `…slice8-a09-tender-rules.md`,
  `…admin-reset-password.md`, `docs/plans/2026-10-10-p0-remediation-plan.md`.
- **Deploy pattern:** CI green on the pushed commit → `gcloud run deploy mandalika-pos --source backend --region
  asia-southeast2 --project mandalika-pos --no-traffic --tag <≥3 chars> --quiet` → smoke the tag URL →
  `update-traffic --to-tags <tag>=100`. APK builds use **origin**: push first, then
  `gh workflow run android-release.yml --ref prod-hardening -f api_url=https://mandalika-pos-538849926142.asia-southeast2.run.app`.
  The release workflow re-runs the PG gate; Docker Hub rate limits ("toomanyrequests") → `gh run rerun <id> --failed`.
- **CI:** backend (`-race`, **gofmt** — committed files must be gofmt-clean; CRLF working copies look dirty locally,
  check with `git show HEAD:<f> | gofmt -l`), Mandatory PostgreSQL (11 gates incl. RF refund parity), JS/TS
  (`corepack pnpm quality:ci`), Chromium browser gate (`corepack pnpm browser:ci`). dependency-security fails on
  24 pre-existing blockers (not a deploy gate). Local PG gate:
  `python scripts/ci/postgres_gate.py --runtime native --pg-bin "C:/Program Files/PostgreSQL/18/bin" --no-race --output <f>.json`.
- **Git hook:** blocks any command line containing `-n`/`--no-…` tokens (also inside commit text, e.g. "pre-native").
  Write commit messages to a file and use `git commit -F <file>`; run greps separately.
- **Hosted checks:** smoke scripts use Node fetch with secrets from Secret Manager (never printed). Neon read-only:
  `psql "$(gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=DATABASE_URL --project mandalika-pos)"` with `BEGIN READ ONLY`.

## Emulator

AVD `mandalika-tab` (Android 15, `userdebug` → `adb root` works). Start cold:
`"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk\emulator\emulator.exe" -avd mandalika-tab -no-snapshot-load`. **Close it before the PC
sleeps** (`adb emu kill`, then stop leftover `emulator.exe`). APK 1.7 installed, admin logged in, **terminal outlet
not yet picked** (prompt "Pilih outlet terminal ini" on next launch → Mandalika BSD).
- DNS often breaks after a cold boot: re-apply Private DNS
  (`settings put global private_dns_mode off`, then `hostname`, `private_dns_specifier dns.google`).
- Read the WebView, not screenshots: `adb forward tcp:9222 localabstract:webview_devtools_remote_<pid>` + a small CDP
  `Runtime.evaluate` helper. Queue: `await Capacitor.Plugins.OutboxJournal.readAll()`; `open()` must report
  `synchronous: 2`, `journalMode: "truncate"`. `mandalika.pos.outbox` in Preferences is only the sentinel now.
- Claude may not type passwords/PINs — the owner logs in (admin `admin@mandalika.test`).
- Test sales: Holy Sweet 10ml (Rp 225.000) at BSD. Receipt numbers BSD-G0010..13 now exist twice on the server
  (June test orders + 2026-10-11 tests) — the known receipt-number reuse, not duplicates.

## Decisions (owner)

- 2026-10-10: shared terminal account; no POS outlet switcher/logout; never wipe an unsynced queue; old-format events
  accepted one release / 14 days then review; cash below total = reject online / accept-and-flag offline; denied offline
  refund = visible review item, never deleted; competing transfer receipt = first wins; tablets at 0 pending before
  sync-changing deploys and APK upgrades.
- 2026-10-11 (slices 6/8): tender ±Rp1; per-method `isCash`; TUNAI blank = exact; offline "Buka Shift" blocked; admin
  picks terminal outlet once; late sales keep their closed shift; reset password rules.
- 2026-10-11 (slice 7): already-refunded/cancelled → refuse → review; refund cash recorded on the refunding shift
  (mig 0047, refunded_by); refund paid back in the original method; backoffice refunds → no drawer; POS refund needs an
  open shift; reason ≥1 non-space, ≤500; tablet remembers synced refunds; server holds shift_close AND shift_open
  behind an earlier temporary failure in the same batch.
- 2026-10-11 (slice 9): journal failure before takeover → keep selling on old storage + warning; after takeover → stop;
  in-repo SQLite plugin; transfer PIN stays in the queued item (follow-up: one-time server approval); OTA strictly newer;
  backup excludes journal + Preferences + WebView/Capgo state; debug logging off; OTA "builtin" risk = release rule now.
- 2026-10-12: **head office** resolves review items (see + mark handled, no approve-and-apply); resolved items are removed
  from the tablet; new permission `resolve_sync_review`; refresh-token TTL **30 days** (`JWT_REFRESH_TTL_HOURS=720`, ships
  with the next backend deploy); **APK 1.7 rollout held** for 1.8 (= 1.7 + review reporting); debug flag stays on until go-live.

## Next

0. **Now:** head-office review resolve screen — spec `docs/plans/2026-10-12-review-resolve-design.md` (awaiting owner
   review) → implementation plan → backend (mig 0048 + TTL) → backoffice → APK 1.8.
1. **Rollout (held for 1.8):** APK 1.8 to every tablet (each at 0 pending first; install over the old app — `install -r` keeps data,
   never uninstall with pending items). Then set `SYNC_LEGACY_ENVELOPE_UNTIL` = rollout date + 14 days.
2. **Before the first OTA release:** min-versionCode guard per OTA release (needs a migration; today any published bundle
   would be offered to a fresh APK reporting `builtin`). Rule meanwhile: OTA bundles only from the newest APK's web layer.
3. **Optional device checks:** slice 7 cross-shift refund then close (cash_refunds_paid), printed recap lines, account
   without process_refund, backoffice refund column/"oleh" on BSD-G0007; slice 9 kill during first migration.
4. **Follow-ups (owner to prioritise):**
   - Quarantine action for a corrupt journal row (`quarantineCorruptRows`
     exists, nothing calls it).
   - Receipt numbers repeat across tablets/reinstalls (`apps/pos/src/cashier/orderRef.ts`) → server sequence or slice 10 device code.
   - Sales made while a shift_open is still syncing carry no shift; backoffice list of late refunds; no client sync batch size cap.
   - Transfer-receive PIN → one-time server approval. `webContentsDebuggingEnabled: true` still TEMP in `capacitor.config.ts`.
   - Slice 8b discount permission.
   - Receipt with stacked promos names one promo and omits points redemption; points claw-back clamps at 0.
   - UTC-date-before-07:00-WIB screens (`CustomerDetail.tsx:41`, `OpnameTab.tsx`, `MovementSummary.tsx:25`, csv names).
   - Operator per shift; password ≥8 on user create/CSV import; slice 10 device registration; engine flush-only N1 LOW.
   - Pre-go-live: audit which real accounts hold `process_refund`.

## Known gaps (not P0)

- A34 parent (CI enforcement) and all release gates remain open. Backoffice polls all order pages every 12 s.
- Cloud Run runs as the default compute SA with `roles/editor` (over-privileged).
- No APK/OTA release ledger (CI artifacts expire after 90 days; OTA bucket empty) → keep APKs in `Downloads/mandalika-apk/`.
- Administrator account had 149 unexpired refresh tokens (shared login) — cleanup/review later.
- Untracked review ZIPs and `PHASE_HANDOFF.md` in the repo root/docs are leftovers (never commit them); stale worktrees
  under `..\mandalika-pos-*` and `.claude\worktrees\` can be removed.

## Working agreements (summary — full text in AGENTS.md)

Six rules (ask / scope / flag / verify / show / admit). Routing: Fable guardian only on request; Opus plan + review of
risky surfaces (every diff touching sync/outbox/stock/auth/payments/generated types, even after fixes — this session's
reviews caught several data-loss bugs); Sonnet implements, tests first; Haiku search/chores. End every reply with the
progress board. Update this file before context compaction and at each milestone.
